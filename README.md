# Bash Script: Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: insufficient error handling during file operations. The `bug.sh` script shows the initial flawed implementation, while `bugSolution.sh` presents a more robust version.

The original script only checks for file existence but lacks error handling for potential issues during the file processing itself (e.g., permission problems, read errors).

The improved script incorporates more comprehensive error handling, making it more reliable and informative in case of failures.
